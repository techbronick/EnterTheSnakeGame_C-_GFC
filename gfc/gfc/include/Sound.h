	// Play the sound.
	// A CSoundPlayer object will always play just one sound at a time. To play several sounds
	// in the same time, use several CSoundPlayer objects.
	// The sound can be played once, repeated a specified number of times or looped continously.
	// The sound may also fade in (played with gradually increasing volume).
	//
	// By default, when called whilst another sound being played by the same player, that sound
	// will be terminated before the new sound starts. This default behaviour may be changed
	// by calling PlayModeAlways/IfIdle/IfNew/Once functions. If the fade-in option is used, 
	// any previous sound will be gradually faded out to create a smooth transition between sounds.
	//
	// Parameters:
	// pSnd - the sound you want to play.
	// filename - filename containing the sound file to play
	// nRep - how many times to repeat the sound AFTER it's played once. Default value of 0
	//        produces no repeatitions (the sound willbe played once). Use -1 for continuous loop.
	// nFadeIn - time [msec] for the sound to fade in. Use 0 for instant play. If any previous sound
	//        is being played by the player while the function is called, it will fade out simultanously
	//        to create a smooth transition between sounds (subject to options setting).
